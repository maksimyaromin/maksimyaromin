### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

By this letter I would like to give a few words about things that make me motivated.

Software Development is being my passion since early childhood. And I am glad I was able to realize my dream. Today I am a professional developer with decades of experience. 

**Challenges** are something that I appreciate most in my work. I love **solving difficult tasks**, **implement new approaches**, and **learn new technologies**.

During my career, I was mostly involved in web design. I developed services and applications of different sizes and for various businesses. 

Currently apart from web design, the sphere of my interests involves machine learning methods, cloud computing, and development for the Open Source community.

I would much appreciate an **opportunity** to work on some **good tool** or **framework** for developers or explore machine learning feasibility.

I am opened to new challenges and ready to change the world.

Kind regards,
Maksim Yaromin.
